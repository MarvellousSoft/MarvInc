Hello again Robot Tester Employee #]]..EMPLOYEE_NUMBER..[[

I can see you've been quite busy around Marvellous Inc. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed and are greatly appreciated by all of us. Especially the Big Bosses.

As you already know, there have been extensive work pilling up in every department, and somehow you got Franz attention for a special task to prove yourself.

Pardon my unprofessionalism, but this is FUCKING HUGE. This is your big shot kiddo, so don't let me down. Use everything you learned so far, and use it efficiently.

I trust you'll do your best. And if you're feeling nervous, stop being nervous and be awesome instead.

Carry on, now and forever.

Chief engineer at Marvellous Inc.s Robot Testing Department
