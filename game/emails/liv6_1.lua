Well, I guess you learned how to use I/O consoles to store lists. Now let's do it without them :P

But first, we're having a happy hour here in SDD after the work hours, wanna join? I guarantee there will be enough booze to make it interesting, also some games and music.

Please don't tell Jen or Franz, as this isn't exactly "allowed" use of the office :P. Also don't tell Richard cause he'll just bore everyone if he comes. Anyways, see you tonight. You'll finally learn what's here called "shot-code-shot-deploy".

Back to the task, it is basically a harder version of the last task. You have no I/O consoles, so you need to store everything in the registers. Also, now values can be removed from the lists.

Till tonight, carry on.
