Hey ]] .. SaveManager.current_user .. [[,

I wanted to say I'm sorry with how I treated you before. I guess being screamed at and humiliated by my bosses made me look back and realize that I was doing basically the same with my 'power'.

I was gonna say it was just some innocent joke, but let's face it, it wasn't. I hope you can forgive me, I'm trying to change my ways.

The bosses, however, are not very forgiving, and are demanding A LOT of me. They've sent me more tasks this week than I've received for the last 3 months. And they want it done FAST.

I know I shouldn't be doing this, but you're the last person I have to turn too, and it's my own fault. If you could help me in this, I would be very grateful. Reply this email and I will send you the task. I've already done some of it, so you just need to do the end.

Thank you anyway!

Fergus
