Shit just keeps piling up. I'm sending you one more.

Look, I know this is not fair. If you solve 2 out of these 3 tasks I sent you, I will solve the hardest and we can hopefully get Christoff off our asses.

As for Carl and Gabe, well, they won't forget this little episode

Let me tell you a bit about this task. We are trying to create a so-called data structure. Basically you have to read a bunch of operations and do what it says for each of them.

Wait, did I tell you you can use characters as numbers? Yep, all characters are numbers, 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98 and so on. Checkout asciitable.com if you need to know more codes. This means 'mov + 12' is the same as 'mov 43 12'. This makes queries look much prettier.

I don't screw up, so you can always assume the input is valid.

Power through, and carry on.
