Continuing our work with data structures, let's talk about lists.

We have worked with sequences before, but now we will be working with a bunch of them at the same time :). I'm sure you will get used to it quickly. For now let's use our (not exactly) new I/O consoles. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Happy coding, and carry on.
