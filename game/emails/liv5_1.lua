I heard you're the new senior in robots!! Nicely done. I always put in a good word for you, glad you could get a post you deserve, you really know you shit. Fergus was just another bullshitter, he won't be missed.

Keep it up and you might even replace Jen :P (don't tell her I said this, she can get really uptight about her job)

Well, now let's get back to work. Even seniors have to do that :D

We have worked with sequences before, but now we will be working with a bunch of them at the same time :). I'm sure you will get used to it quickly. For now let's use our (not exactly) new I/O consoles. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Keep senioring, and carry on.
