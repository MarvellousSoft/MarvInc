Well done. Those three weren't easy problems. Hope you keep up.

Since you're so excited, I'm giving you a puzzle that we have here in our department. No one, not even me, was able to solve it. Arthur, an intern, left it here a couple years ago, with the hint "To go north, you must go south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.".

At first it seems like an easy division problem, but its restraints on lines and registers are RIDICULOUS. We bothered him a bit more, telling him it was impossible and that his Game of Thrones* reference was lame.

He then said that what he actually meant that we should use the fact that the numbers are 'cyclical' (999 + 1 = -999 and so on). Looking back, his reference was quite good. He's since left the company and won't answer my texts.

Anyways, here is the puzzle. Don't bother if you can't solve it, none of us could. It must be some kind of trick.

All men must carry on.
