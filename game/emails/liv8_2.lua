Good afternoon. Olivia told me to send you some brainfuck examples in case you still didn't get it. You won't need to code anything in it, but since you're gonna write an interpreter it is essential to understand it.

I'll be demonstrating only the basic instructions in this email.
    ",>,<.>."
This example will read two values and print them again, but swapped. It uses two arrays positions to do that.
    "+.<-.>+.<-.>+.<-."
This example will print 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, using two array positions as well.

Hope you got it. If you need more help, Google it.

Nice to see you again, carry on.
