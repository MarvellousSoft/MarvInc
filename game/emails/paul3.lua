Shit man. Shit's burning here. And not the good stuff dude. So, remember what we talked about? Of using Reactor 13 for our experiment? I might have overestimated the amount of energy the KL212 could withstand...

Anyways, the reactor is on fire and they've closed down the B Wing to avoid the radiation to escape. Don't worry, it's ok. We're not getting any more radiation then we already get working here. And don't worry, those lead walls won't let any bad stuff get out. Trust me, I designed those doors!

So hey man, I need a favor. Corporate agreed to let this go if I take care of B Wing and Reactor 13. The problem is, the path to Reactor 13's core is kinda obstructed by all the shit that blew up, and cleaning the way would mean exposing for too long my interns to radiation - and we both know corporate wouldn't like the resulting lawsuits. So I thought, corporate doesn't care about "robots", so why not use this task?

Whenever you get the chance, mind getting B Wing sorted?

Groove on,
