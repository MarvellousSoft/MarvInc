Seriously, dude. I owe you one. Great work!

As all Verkeufens, I am a man of my word. And I gave you mine. So listen, I'm throwing a party at my house to celebrate a very special date and you're my special guest! You should get an invitation soon. Really hoping you show up, dude. Let me know if you can make it.
