It seems you have not understood this system completely. Let me explain it further.

There are three tabs: <email>, <terminal> and <info>. You are on the first one, and here you can read your emails. On the <terminal> tab you can write and run commands. For now you only need the one I taught you (walk) to solve this introductory puzzle. On the last tab, <info>, you can check the puzzle's objectives and the current test robot information.

Whenever you're lost, you can reread these emails. Unless you've deleted them.

Good Luck, and carry on.
