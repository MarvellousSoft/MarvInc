As you were already told, consoles are the big colorful computers sitting around The Room. The robot can interact with them, writing output for them to receive, or reading input from them, as you will see in the future.

The color of the console usually represents what it can influence in the room, such as lasers or even other consoles.

The number above a console indicates how many inputs it can still provide to the bot, or how many outputs it has received from the bot. Use this for your advantage in planning programs.

That's it for now. Carry on.
