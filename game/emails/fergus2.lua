You solved it faster than expected! This is the real Fergus Gerhard Jacobsen, I'm sorry the last email was automated, but you know how it is hahahah, I simply do not have the TIME to write so many personal emails to the beginners.

You see, I have a great number of tasks here, but I think they would just be TOO MUCH for a junior tester. So I took the time to create a special task for you, and I believe you will enjoy solving it and helping us here at Marvellous Inc, without feeling overwhelmed.

Keep improving yourself, and carry on.
