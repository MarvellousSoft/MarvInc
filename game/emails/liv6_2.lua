As you can see, this task is actually reasonably harder than the last one. The catch is, you don't have too much storage, so you cannot store all MAXIMUM SIZES for all lists, since that would need about 8 * 50 = 400 registers.

You can, however, store all values given in input. So you need to find some way to grow the lists, or something like that. There are some efficient ways, and some not so efficient, most likely any of them will work here.

If you want to know about the efficient way, you should remember "linked lists", you probably had that in your Computer Science major.
