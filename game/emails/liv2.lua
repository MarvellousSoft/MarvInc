Don't be discouraged about the thing about Fergus, people overhype him ~cof cof kiss ass cof cof~

Anyways, let's keep going. Sending you one last warmup, since things are getting hot here. Franz is at materials 'getting results', and it seems he's coming here next. Gotta clean some shit up :B

In other tasks, you could just write code and repeat it until it was done. In this task, and others in the future, you're gonna need to know when it is over. In this, for example, we added a sequence of size 0 on the end, so you know when the input is over.

Vega, the other newbie at robots, was also sent this task.

Carry on :)
