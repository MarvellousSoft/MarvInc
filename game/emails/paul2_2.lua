Oh shit man, I was so spaced out I almost forgot to tell you. Remember the thing I told you about yesterday? About that small survey I made here at MarvInc on legalizing weed? Well, the results are in, man! But man, I didn't expect so many votes, dude. There must be like hundreds. And counting one by one is going to take forever. So on one of my trips I was thinking, hey you know what would be cool? If we had like "robots" or something, you know? That could, like, totally do them for us, yeah? And then I remembered, man! You do that kinda stuff. So could you lend me a robotic hand on this? Would really appreciate it, my man!

Trip on, dude
