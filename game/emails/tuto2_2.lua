The <terminal> is a powerful tool.

As we said before, you should use it just like any text editor. To mention some of its features, you can

- Move the cursor with your mouse or arrow keys

- Select text holding shift and pressing the arrow keys

- Use the 'end' or 'home' keys

- And much more!

Exploring is part of the job, so get used to it.

Happy coding, and carry on.
