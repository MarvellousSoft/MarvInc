The <terminal> is a powerful tool.

As we said before, you should use it just like any text editor. To mention some of its features, you can

- Move the cursor with your mouse or arrow keys

- Select text with the mouse holding shift and pressing the arrow keys

- Use the 'end' or 'home' keys

- Use ctrl-c, ctrl-x and ctrl-v to copy, cut and paste text

- Use ctrl-z and ctrl-y to undo or redo actions

- And much more!

Exploring is part of the job, so get used to it.

Happy coding, and carry on.
