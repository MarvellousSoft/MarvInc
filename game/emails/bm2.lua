Hey,

Well, first of all I apologize for my behavior during Liv's party. Sometimes I tend to overestimate my drinking tolerance. I don't remember much from that day (or from the day after), but I'll apologize in case I did anything sudden or inappropriate.

I've got this raging hangover that won't quit, so I can't do much work. We still need your help on coding, and part of what needs to be done is finding the LCM of a number. I'm sure you can handle it.

Bill
