Hello, this is Rick. Liv told me to send you some brainfuck examples in case you still didn't get it. You won't need to code anything in it, but since you're gonna write an interpreter it is essential to understand it.

Let's just use the basic instructions for now.
    ",>,<.>."
This, for example, will read two values and print them again, but swapped. It uses two arrays positions to do that.
    "+,<-,>+.<-,>+,<-,"
This will print 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, using two array positions as well.

Hope you got it. If you need more help, Google it.

Pleasure to meet you, carry on.
