Kept you waiting, huh?

So, that first data structure was simple, but I've seen something glow in Franz's eyes when he saw it done. Let's keep doing it then, I'm sure it will keep the managers happy and it's pretty cool. L++ rulz

This one might seen the same as the other, but it harder. Remember it doesn't matter where you store the values, as long as your answers are corrent.

Also, notice, like in the previous DS, you can store all values *currently* on the DS (at most 20), but there are not enough registers to store all the values that were ever added to the DS (at most 100).

Happy coding, and carry on.
