**hump** - Helper Utilities for a Multitude of Problems
=======================================================

**hump** is a set of lightweight helpers for the awesome `LÃ–VE
<http://love2d.org>`_ game framework.  It will help to get you over the initial
hump when starting to build a new game.

**hump** differs from many other libraries in that every component is
independent of the remaining ones.
The footprint is very small, so the library should fit nicely into your
projects.
