hump.gamestate
==============

::

    Gamestate = require "hump.gamestate"

A gamestate encapsulates independent data an behaviour in a single table.

A typical game could consist of a menu-state, a level-state and a game-over-state.

**Example**::

    local menu = {} -- previously: Gamestate.new()
    local game = {}

    function menu:draw()
        love.graphics.print("Press Enter to continue", 10, 10)
    end

    function menu:keyreleased(key, code)
        if key == 'enter' then
            Gamestate.switch(game)
        end
    end

    function game:enter()
        Entities.clear()
        -- setup entities here
    end

    function game:update(dt)
        Entities.update(dt)
    end

    function game:draw()
        Entities.draw()
    end

    function love.load()
        Gamestate.registerEvents()
        Gamestate.switch(menu)
    end


.. _callbacks:

Gamestate Callbacks
-------------------

A gamestate can define all callbacks that LÖVE defines. In addition, there are
callbacks for initalizing, entering and leaving a state:

``init()``
    Called once, and only once, before entering the state the first time. See
    :func:`Gamestate.switch`.

``enter(previous, ...)``
    Called every time when entering the state. See :func:`Gamestate.switch`.

``leave()``
    Called when leaving a state. See :func:`Gamestate.switch` and :func:`Gamestate.push`.

``resume()``
    Called when re-entering a state by :func:`Gamestate.pop`-ing another state.

``update()``
    Update the game state. Called every frame.

``draw()``
    Draw on the screen. Called every frame.

``focus()``
    Called if the window gets or looses focus.

``keypressed()``
    Triggered when a key is pressed.

``keyreleased()``
    Triggered when a key is released.

``mousepressed()``
    Triggered when a mouse button is pressed.

``mousereleased()``
    Triggered when a mouse button is released.

``joystickpressed()``
    Triggered when a joystick button is pressed.

``joystickreleased()``
    Triggered when a joystick button is released.

``quit()``
    Called on quitting the game. Only called on the active gamestate.

When using :func:`Gamestate.registerEvents`, all these callbacks will be called by the
corresponding LÖVE callbacks and receive receive the same arguments (e.g.
``state:update(dt)`` will be called by ``love.update(dt)``).

**Example**::

    menu = {} -- previously: Gamestate.new()

    function menu:init()
        self.background = love.graphics.newImage('bg.jpg')
        Buttons.initialize()
    end

    function menu:enter(previous) -- runs every time the state is entered
        Buttons.setActive(Buttons.start)
    end

    function menu:update(dt) -- runs every frame
        Buttons.update(dt)
    end

    function menu:draw()
        love.graphics.draw(self.background, 0, 0)
        Buttons.draw()
    end

    function menu:keyreleased(key)
        if key == 'up' then
            Buttons.selectPrevious()
        elseif key == 'down' then
            Buttons.selectNext()
        elseif
            Buttons.active:onClick()
        end
    end

    function menu:mousereleased(x,y, mouse_btn)
        local button = Buttons.hovered(x,y)
        if button then
            Button.select(button)
            if mouse_btn == 'l' then
                button:onClick()
            end
        end
    end


Function Reference
------------------

.. function:: Gamestate.new()

   :returns: An empty table.


**Deprecated: Use the table constructor instead (see example)**

Declare a new gamestate (just an empty table). A gamestate can define several
callbacks.

**Example**::

    menu = {}
    -- deprecated method:
    menu = Gamestate.new()


.. function:: Gamestate.switch(to, ...)

   :param Gamestate to: Target gamestate.
   :param mixed ...: Additional arguments to pass to ``to:enter(current, ...)``.
   :returns: The results of ``to:enter(current, ...)``.


Switch to a gamestate, with any additional arguments passed to the new state.

Switching a gamestate will call the ``leave()`` callback on the current
gamestate, replace the current gamestate with ``to``, call the ``init()`` function
if, and only if, the state was not yet inialized and finally call
``enter(old_state, ...)`` on the new gamestate.

.. note::
    Processing of callbacks is suspended until ``update()`` is called on the new
    gamestate, but the function calling :func:`Gamestate.switch` can still continue - it is
    your job to make sure this is handled correctly. See also the examples below.


**Examples**::

    Gamestate.switch(game, level_two)

::

    -- stop execution of the current state by using return
    if player.has_died then
        return Gamestate.switch(game, level_two)
    end

    -- this will not be called when the state is switched
    player:update()



.. function:: Gamestate.Gamestate.current()

   :returns: The active gamestate.

Returns the currently activated gamestate.

**Example**::

    function love.keypressed(key)
        if Gamestate.current() ~= menu and key == 'p' then
            Gamestate.push(pause)
        end
    end


.. function:: Gamestate.push(to, ...)

   :param Gamestate to: Target gamestate.
   :param mixed ...: Additional arguments to pass to ``to:enter(current, ...)``.
   :returns: The results of ``to:enter(current, ...)``.

Pushes the ``to`` on top of the state stack, i.e. makes it the active state.
Semantics are the same as ``switch(to, ...)``, except that ``leave()`` is *not*
called on the previously active state.

Useful for pause screens, menus, etc.

.. note::
    Processing of callbacks is suspended until ``update()`` is called on the
    new gamestate, but the function calling ``GS.push()`` can still continue -
    it is your job to make sure this is handled correctly. See also the
    example below.


**Example**::

    -- pause gamestate
    Pause = Gamestate.new()
    function Pause:enter(from)
        self.from = from -- record previous state
    end

    function Pause:draw()
        local W, H = love.graphics.getWidth(), love.graphics.getHeight()
        -- draw previous screen
        self.from:draw()
        -- overlay with pause message
        love.graphics.setColor(0,0,0, 100)
        love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 0,0, W,H)
        love.graphics.setColor(255,255,255)
        love.graphics.printf('PAUSE', 0, H/2, W, 'center')
    end

    -- [...]
    function love.keypressed(key)
        if Gamestate.current() ~= menu and key == 'p' then
            return Gamestate.push(pause)
        end
    end


.. function:: Gamestate.pop(...)

   :returns: The results of ``new_state:resume(...)``.

Calls ``leave()`` on the current state and then removes it from the stack, making
the state below the current state and calls ``resume(...)`` on the activated state.
Does *not* call ``enter()`` on the activated state.

.. note::
    Processing of callbacks is suspended until ``update()`` is called on the
    new gamestate, but the function calling ``GS.pop()`` can still continue -
    it is your job to make sure this is handled correctly. See also the
    example below.


**Example**::

    -- extending the example of Gamestate.push() above
    function Pause:keypressed(key)
        if key == 'p' then
            return Gamestate.pop() -- return to previous state
        end
    end


.. function:: Gamestate.<callback>(...)

   :param mixed ...:  Arguments to pass to the corresponding function.
   :returns: The result of the callback function.

Calls a function on the current gamestate. Can be any function, but is intended
to be one of the :ref:`callbacks`. Mostly useful when not using
:func:`Gamestate.registerEvents`.

**Example**::

    function love.draw()
        Gamestate.draw() -- <callback> is `draw'
    end

    function love.update(dt)
        Gamestate.update(dt) -- pass dt to currentState:update(dt)
    end

    function love.keypressed(key, code)
        Gamestate.keypressed(key, code) -- pass multiple arguments
    end


.. function:: Gamestate.registerEvents([callbacks])

   :param table callbacks: Names of the callbacks to register. If omitted,
                           register all love callbacks (optional).

Overwrite love callbacks to call ``Gamestate.update()``, ``Gamestate.draw()``,
etc. automatically. ``love`` callbacks (e.g. ``love.update()``) are still
invoked as usual.

This is by done by overwriting the love callbacks, e.g.::

    local old_update = love.update
    function love.update(dt)
        old_update(dt)
        return Gamestate.current:update(dt)
    end

.. note::
    Only works when called in love.load() or any other function that is
    executed *after* the whole file is loaded.

**Examples**::

    function love.load()
        Gamestate.registerEvents()
        Gamestate.switch(menu)
    end

    -- love callback will still be invoked
    function love.update(dt)
        Timer.update(dt)
        -- no need for Gamestate.update(dt)
    end

::

    function love.load()
        -- only register draw, update and quit
        Gamestate.registerEvents{'draw', 'update', 'quit'}
        Gamestate.switch(menu)
    end
