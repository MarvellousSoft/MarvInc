-- This is a sample level script.
-- We showcase how to write your own puzzles and emails.

-- DISCLAIMER:
-- Before we start, we would like to give out a warning. Puzzles are made by the community, and not
-- the developers, meaning we are not responsible for any deaths, injuries or damages to you or
-- your loved ones (this includes your PC) in case you decide running some sketchy guy's puzzle
-- script. Puzzles are run in a separate environment which contains only safe-ish (emphasis on ish)
-- lua functions. Having said that, we still highly recommend you scanning over any community
-- puzzle for malicious or obfuscated code.  Of course, the art of code obfuscation is a pathway
-- many would consider unnatural, so sometimes just looking through one's code may not reveal
-- anything. In order to prevent any of this naughty business, we give out these three do's and
-- three don'ts for anyone who writes puzzles for MarvInc:
--  1. Do document your code (so people know what they're running on their machines).
--  2. Do have fun writing your puzzle.
--  3. Do give support for those who play your puzzle.
--  4. Don't obfuscate code.
--  5. Don't falsely advertise what your puzzle does (this just raises suspicions on your code).
--  6. Don't be a dick.
-- If everyone followed these rules, the world would be a better place. So make the world better.

-- We call a Level Script (LS for short) a .lua file that contains a puzzle. We call an Email
-- Script (ES) a .lua file that contains an email that should trigger the puzzle. Another sample
-- .lua named email.lua can be found in this same directory explaining how to create your
-- Email Script.

-- A custom puzzle file structure should be as follows. Let / (root) directory be where MarvInc
-- stores its user data (for Windows that'd be AppData, on Linux ~/.local/share/love/marvellous/).
-- A typical puzzle looks something like this:
--
-- /
-- *- custom/
-- *--*-- my_puzzle/
-- *--*--*-- level.lua
-- *--*--*-- email.lua
-- *--*--*-- assets/
-- *--*--*--*-- my_tile.png
-- *--*--*--*-- my_image.png
-- *--*--*--*-- my_sprite.png
--
-- Directory /custom/ is where custom puzzles should be stored. Each puzzle should have its own
-- directory with a unique name. Inside each puzzle directory, two .lua files should be present.
-- The first, level.lua, is the Level Script. The second, email.lua is the Email Script. Any assets
-- should be inside your puzzle directory. How you're going to name them, or where they're going to
-- be located inside this directory is up to you. Just recall that when importing assets, you
-- should tell the parser its relative path in relation to your puzzle directory. So in the above
-- example, you should import my_image.png through the relative path "assets/my_image.png".

-- PUZZLE SCRIPT

-- Just like in any programming language, a LS has reserved keywords. Reserved keywords all begin
-- with a capital letter. We list the reserved keywords, as well as their descriptions and types
-- below:

-- The puzzle's title (string). This should appear in the info tab.
Meta.SetName "Puzzle name"
-- Its unique numbering (string). Usually it follows a certain pattern related to the email chain.
Meta.SetID "S.1"
-- The number of lines of code available for the user (int). If <= 0, sets it to 99.
Meta.SetLines(30)
-- The number of registers available for the user (int). Must be >= 0.
Meta.SetMemory(12)
-- A description of this puzzle's objectives (string).
Objective.SetText [[
These are the objectives for this puzzle:
- Write code.
- Be efficient.
- Don't be messy.
- Have fun.
]]
-- Extra information you might want to inform the user of (string).
Meta.SetInfo [[
Share us your solutions!
]]

-- A puzzle map is two-layered. The bottom-most layer only draws the floor, whilst the top layer
-- handles objects. We refer to the bottom layer as the Floor Layer, and the top one as the Object
-- Layer.

-- During development, we found that the easiest way to both visualize and code a puzzle map was to
-- have a single string representing layers, instead of a matrix. Graphically, it is simpler, but
-- it comes with restrictions: objects must be represented by a single character.

-- The Floor Layer (string).
Floor.SetAll("....................."..
             "....................."..
             "......*.......*......"..
             "......***...***......"..
             "......*..*.*..*......"..
             "......*...*...*......"..
             "......*.......*......"..
             "....................."..
             ".......@..@..@......."..
             "........@.@.@........"..
             "......@@@@@@@@@......"..
             "........@.@.@........"..
             ".......@..@..@......."..
             "....................."..
             "......=========......"..
             "..........=.........."..
             "..........=.........."..
             "..........=.........."..
             "..........=.........."..
             "......=========......"..
             ".....................")

-- Each character in the string Floor.L is a tile sprite. To register a tile sprite to a character,
-- use the function Floor:Register.
Floor.Register("white_floor", '.')
Floor.Register("red_tile",    '*')
Floor.Register("green_tile",  '@')
Floor.Register("blue_tile",   '=')

-- Alternatively, if you want to generate a floor map procedurally, it can be easier to just give
-- the tile positions. Indexing starts at 1. PS: Remember to register the tiles before placing them!
Floor.Register("blood_splat_1", 'b')
Floor.Register("blood_splat_2", 'd')
Floor.PlaceAt("blood_splat_1", 1, 1)
Floor.PlaceAt("blood_splat_2", ROWS, COLS)

-- The following are keywords for constants:
-- ROWS: number of rows
-- COLS: number of columns

-- Declaration of the Floor map is not required. You can use Floor:PlaceAt to cover all tiles and
-- not declare the Floor object. Note, however, that if the map floor is not completely filled, the
-- parser will stop and output an error.

-- For both Object and Floor maps, unregistered characters are set to nothing.

-- The Object Layer (string).
Objects.SetAll("---------------------"..

-- The Object map works the same way as the Floor map. To register an object, you must first
-- construct a new object instance and link a character to it.

b = Bucket {
    content = "water"
}
Objects.Register(b, 'b')

-- You can also use PlaceAt the same way.
d = Bucket {
    content = "paint",
    color = "red"
}

Objects.PlaceAt(d, 10, 10)

-- If you want to limit the player's range without having to place a bunch of objects as obstacles,
-- you can simply use InvWall to set invisible walls throughout the map. Just like Floor and
-- Objects, InvWall uses similar syntax and functions. However, it can be kept undeclared and
-- the game will assume there are no invisible walls. Each position in the InvWall can either be ' '
-- (no invisible wall) or '*' (invisible wall).

InvWall.SetAll("                     "..

-- If you want to use a custom image, you can import it using the builtin function Import:Image. It
-- accepts two arguments. The first is a key you want to refer the image as. The second is its
-- relative path (to this .lua file). This image will then be imported to an image table, and can
-- be referred later through its key.
Import.Image("my_img", "example.png")

-- If you want to use a sprite (an animated image), you can import a spritesheet. We only accept
-- horizontal spritesheets, meaning the spritesheet must contain one line. To import a spritesheet,
-- use the builtin function Import:Sprite. This function accepts three arguments: its reference key,
-- the number of frames in the spritesheet and its path.
Import.Sprite("my_sprite", 3, "example_sheet.png")

-- You can add a new floor tile image using the function below.
Import.Tile("my_tile", "tile.png")

-- And place the new tile using Floor:Register. Note that Floor gives preference to custom tiles.
-- So if you name your new tile "white_floor", all "white_floor" tiles placed in this puzzle will
-- be look like the one you imported.

-- All paths must point to your puzzle directory.

-- CAUTION! --
-- Reference keys for Images and Sprites cannot have same names! Otherwise it becomes ambiguous
-- whether you're refering to a sprite or an image. Also note that not all objects support sprites
-- (as of yet, we may add this feature later). If you're not sure if a constructor accepts an
-- image, a sprite or both, check the list below.

-- Each object has its own constructor. Below is a list of objects, their constructors and
-- arguments they admit.

    c       - color to be used to color over this object [string]
    key_off - reference key to an image for when the DeadSwitch is "off" (if nil or omitted, it just disappears) [string]
    bckt    - whether this DeadSwitch can be turned off with a bucket's content (if omitted, false) [boolean]

// Lava. It behaves just like real-world lava, in that if you throw water or paint in it, it
// instantly becomes a solid piece of rock. Lava is a DeadSwitch triggered by water.
Lava()

// A Console object is a computer that allows either input or output (but not both).
Console(img, c, bg, data, n)

    n    - how many entries should the console show above it [int]

// An emitter emits a constant stream of deadly laser to a certain direction until obstructed by something.
// An emitter can be turned on or off by a console of the same color as its laser's color.
Emitter(img, bg, c, r_key, r_bg, r_d, r_c)
    img   - key reference to an image [string]
