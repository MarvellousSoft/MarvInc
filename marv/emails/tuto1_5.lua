Well, we all have our hard days.

The problem consists of moving the robot to the red tile. The path is unique, so the instructions should be very direct. You should write the following code on your %blue% <code> %end% tab, then hit the %orange% play %end% button to start the simulation.

    - %inst% walk %dir% left %end%
      %inst% walk %dir% up %end%
      %inst% walk %dir% right %end%

Carry on.]],
