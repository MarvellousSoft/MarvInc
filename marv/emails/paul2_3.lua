First of all, appreciate the help man. Without you we would still be counting the {gray}votes{end}. But aww man, shit. I know this is like, {blue}democracy{end}, man. But shit. It was a {brown}tight{end} vote, but it doesn't make any sense, you know? I mean, the guys at {purple}Biochem{end} are totally {green}pro-blunt{end}, but the count says they don't want no {green}legalization{end}. That don't make no sense, right?! Shit man. You think maybe {red}the system is broken{end}? You think maybe {red}this voting system ain't right{end}? Like, instead of {orange}dividing by department{end} and making {gray}voting optional{end}, we should have {cyan}mandatory voting{end} for important subjects and an {cyan}open, direct voting system{end} so {red}gerrymandering, lobbying and the preservation of the status-quo{end} don't dictate the choice of the {blue}people{end}? Ya know? But maybe I'm just a {cyan}dreamer{end}, man. The {red}system ain't right{end}, dude. It ain't.

{red}Fuck the system.{end}
