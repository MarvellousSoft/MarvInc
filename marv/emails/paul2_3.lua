First of all, appreciate the help man. Without you we would still be counting the votes. But aww man, shit. I know this is like, democracy, man. But shit. It was a tight vote, but it doesn't make any sense, you know? I mean, the guys at Biochem are totally pro-blunt, but the count says they don't want no legalization. That don't make no sense, right?! Shit man. You think maybe the system is broken? You think maybe this voting system ain't right? Like, instead of dividing by department and making voting optional, we should have mandatory voting for important subjects and an open, direct voting system so gerrymandering, lobbying and the preservation of the status-quo don't dictate the choice of the people? Ya know? But maybe I'm just a dreamer, man. The system ain't right, dude. It ain't.

Fuck the system.
