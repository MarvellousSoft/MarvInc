You did your task with excellence, but I can't say I'm impressed. {blue}Licking the Statue of Liberty{end}. That would be impressive.

But I'm happy to say {brown}Franz{end} is satisfied with your progress, and you got a well deserved promotion: {pink}Fergus{end} position. Don't worry about him, he was a liabilty this company couldn't afford anymore, so we sent him away. You won't be seeing him around anymore. I can guarantee. {purple}:){end}

To celebrate the occasion I've arranged one of the interns to upgrade your {green}OS{end} to the most recent version. Enjoy.

Things will be a lot harder from now on. Keep up the good work, you're on the right track.

Carry on, now and forever.

{gray}PS: If you were still wondering, that task objective was to create a cleaning algorithm for our cafeteria. Marvinc will be cleaner thanks to you. {purple}Good job{gray}.{end}
