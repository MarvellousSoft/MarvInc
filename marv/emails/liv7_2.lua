Shit. I sent that email before finishing it properly {red}:P{end}
Well, worked out fine, since the lazy programmers in the email area still didn't implement sending two tasks in one email.

Ok. What you have to do in the tasks is to actually {red}sort a sequence{end}. Both tasks may seem very similar, but if you look carefully to their restrictions, you'll see they're {red}quite different {end}(and aren't supposed to be solved the same way).

Here is the second task. Do whichever is easier for you. If you have no idea, don't be ashamed to {red}search the internet{end}. Being a head engineer doesn't mean you know your shit (quite the opposite, usually).

Boss away, and carry on.
