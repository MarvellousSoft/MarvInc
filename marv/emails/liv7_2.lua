Well, worked out fine, since the lazy programmers in the email area still didn't implement sending two tasks in one email.

Ok. What you have to do in the tasks is to actually {red}sort a sequence{end}. Both tasks may seem very similar, but if you look carefully to their restrictions, you'll see they're {red}quite different {end}(and aren't supposed to be solved the same way).
