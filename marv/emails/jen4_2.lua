Hello {blue}CS2{end}. I've just received notification of your performance in the last puzzle I've sent you, and honestly I expected an algorithm a little more... {red}efficient{end}.

Oh well, I guess you did the best you could. But I guess I thought your best would be a little less...{gray}how should I say without demotivating you...{brown}mediocre{end}.

I won't force you into making a better version of the puzzle. But I'm expecting you to improve your perfomance in future {purple}Senior Tasks{end}. Quoting {pink}CS1{end}, {pink}"bro you can do better"{end}.

Carry on {blue}CS2{end}.
