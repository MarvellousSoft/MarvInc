As you were already told, {orange}consoles {end}are the big colorful computers sitting around the test area. The robot can interact with them, writing output for them to receive, or reading input from them, as you will see in the future.

The color of the {orange}console {end}usually represents what it can influence in the room, such as lasers or even other {orange}consoles{end}.

The numbers above a console indicates the inputs it can still provide to the bot, or the outputs it has received from the bot. Use this for your advantage in planning or fixing programs.

Lastly, robots are {red}tr00 h4ck3rs{end}, so they can access a console from any direction, even from the back. Don't ask how they do it, they just can.

That's it for now. Carry on.
