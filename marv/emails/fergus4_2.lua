Liv, from Software Dev, has been breathing on my neck ever since my goddamn trip. She is crazy. Just now she sent me 2 tasks to solve asap, even with all the other ones I still have to do. She seriously needs a boyfriend.

I'm freaking out here. I might be done. Please help me get this bitch off my ass. Solve this task, and I'll solve the other.

I know I'm asking for a lot, but I know you're a good person, and my job is on the line. I swear this won't happen again.

We have to visualize ourselves solving these tasks and it will all happen!!!
