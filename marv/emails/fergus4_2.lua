Liv, from Software Dev, has been breathing on my neck ever since my goddamn trip. {red}She is crazy{end}. Just now she sent me 2 tasks to solve asap, even with all the other ones I still have to do. {red}She seriously needs a boyfriend{end}.

I'm freaking out here. I might be done. Please help me get this {red}bitch{end} off my ass. Solve this task, and I'll solve the other.

I know I'm asking for a lot, but I {orange}know you're a good person{end}, and my job is on the line. I swear this won't happen again.

We have to visualize ourselves solving these tasks and {orange}it will all happen{end}!!!
