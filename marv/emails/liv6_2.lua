As you can see, this task is actually reasonably {red}harder {end}than the last one. The catch is, you don't have too much storage, so you cannot store all {red}MAXIMUM SIZES {end}for all lists, since that would need about 8 * 50 = 400 {addr}registers{end}.

You can, however, store all values {red}given in input{end}. So you need to find some way to grow the lists, or something like that. There are some efficient ways, and some not so efficient, most likely {red}any of them {end}will work here.

If you want to know about the efficient way, you should remember {ds}"linked lists"{end}, you probably had that in your {red}Computer Science {end}major.
