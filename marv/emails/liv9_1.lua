{red}Holy fuck{end}. Corporate are really, {red}really{end} fucking stupid.

As you can see, everything is fucking falling apart, but they still think my {purple}Project Brainfuck{end} will be a game-changer hahahahaha. They are sending all their (unfrozen) resources here. I got 100 new servers, and I'm running some stupid busy loop on them to pretend they are being used to their full power.

Franz started sending me emails, talking about our purpose in the history of humankind and other epic shit like that. I always knew the bots seemed to good to be true, but... {red}Fuck it all{end}. I'm jumping ship.

Richard will send you some task related to what you were doing. As always, he is fucking oblivious. Do it, don't do it, {red}I don't fucking care{end}. I'll be taking care of myself, finding some nice job at some Google office far from here, and relaxing with my fat paycheck.

Fuck you too, carry on.
