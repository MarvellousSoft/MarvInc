You solved it faster than expected! This is the real Fergus Gerhard Jacobsen, {blue}Senior Robot Tester{end}, I'm sorry the last email was automated, but you know how it is hahahah, I simply {orange}do not have the time{end} to write so many personal emails to the {orange}beginners{end}.

You see, I have a great number of tasks here, but I think they would just be {orange}too much{end} for a {orange}junior tester{end}. So I took the time to create a {orange}special{end} task for you, and I believe you will enjoy solving it and helping us here at Marvellous Inc, {orange}without feeling overwhelmed{end}.

Keep improving yourself, and carry on.
