Hello Robot Tester Employee #]]..EMPLOYEE_NUMBER..[[

First of all, I own you my sincere apologies for my previous email. I had a little wine at my break hours, and I got carried away for a bit.

If you could erase it and pretend that it never happened, I would be grateful.

But at least the record show you have completed the beta version of our latest Navigation System test room with perfection. I think you can handle the real deal now. Please let me know if you are willing to try it. Also I forgot to tell you the most important feature in the new OS you are using: you can name your registers! You can write a label for each one when your mouse is over them. You can use the name of a register as an address in our code, instead of using its number. Remember this employee.

Once again, I'm sorry for my lack of profissionalism, it will not happen again.
And please call me Janine at the work enviroment.

Suit up and carry on.
