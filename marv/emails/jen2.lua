Hello Robot Tester Employee #]]..EMPLOYEE_NUMBER..[[

First of all, I own you my sincere apologies for my previous email. I had a little wine at my break hours, and I got carried away for a bit.

If you could {red}erase it{end} and pretend that it never happened, I would be grateful.

But at least the record show you have completed the beta version of our latest {purple}Navigation System{end} test room with perfection. I think you can handle the {red}real deal{end} now. Please let me know if you are willing to try it.

Once again, I'm sorry for my lack of profissionalism, it will not happen again.
{gray}And please call me {red}Janine{gray} at the work enviroment.{end}

Suit up and carry on.

Janine Leubwitz
