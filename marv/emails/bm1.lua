Hey,

It's {red}Bill Davis{end} (and I'm CC-ing {blue}Miles Evans{end}) the two handsome math fellas you met at {green}Paul's{end}.

As we told you before, I'm a {gray}mathematician{end} (and Miles is an {gray}applied mathematician{end}). My work is on {orange}algebraic number theory{end} with a focus on {orange}Galois fields{end}. Miles' is on {pink}coding theory{end}, {pink}cryptography{end} and {pink}error-correction{end}. But we're both working on a joint project on {pink}cryptography{end} for now.

We heard from {green}Paul{end} and {cyan}Liv{end} that you've been useful on the coding department and as you may or may not know, {pink}cryptography{end} deals with big numbers and on how to factorize them. We plan on publishing a paper, and it'd be nice to have some working code. And we were thinking you could do such a thing.

But first you gotta prove it to us that you can deal with the {gray}abstract{end}. If you're interested, we'd like you to apply a simple math concept you may have learned in middle-school.

Make your code sing.

Bill Davis
