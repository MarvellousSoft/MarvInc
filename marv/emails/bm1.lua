Hey,

It's Bill Davis (and I'm CC-ing Miles Evans) the two handsome math fellas you met at Paul's.

As we told you before, I'm a mathematician (and Miles is an applied mathematician). My work is on algebraic number theory with a focus on Galois fields. Mile's is on coding theory, cryptography and error-correction. But we're both working on a joint project on cryptography for now.

We heard from Paul and Liv that you've been useful on the coding department and as you may or may not know, cryptography deals with big numbers and on how to factorize them. We plan on publishing an article, and it'd be nice to have a working code of it. And we were thinking you could do such a thing.

But first you gotta prove it to us that you can deal with the abstract. If you're interested, we'd like you to apply a simple math concept you probably had in mid-school.

Make your code sing.

Bill Davis
