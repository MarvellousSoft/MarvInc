%red% Fuck %end% . I've been throwing some stuff at Vega too, but it seems like he can't handle his %red% fucking %end% work. Fergus went out on his 'trip' just when that fucker would finally be useful

Technology department sent us this task. They can't solve %red% ONE %end% fucking coding problem.

I gave this to Vega, but he clearly isn't %red% fucking %end% ready for it, so it's yours now. I didn't have time to fix their %red% DISGUSTING %end% i/o, deal with it.

:XXXX Come on you gotta work double here. Solve it %yellow% quick %end% ]],
