{cyan}BSF{end}, let's stop bullshitting one another okay? By now you must have realised what is really happening behind the scenes at {blue}MarvInc{end}, but if you're so naïve to think you're still dealing with {gray}"robots"{end}, then you are truly an idiot.

I admit I was {gray}a bit{end} mad and... how should I say... {purple}"apprehensive"{end} when Franz gave you my position, but given how I got my position first place, you probably did or saw something that made him {gray}anxious{end}. That being said, we are still in a pile of {brown}excrement{end}, and this FBI thing is causing more mayhem than I imagined. I don't think neither of us are getting out of here intact, but I'm not going out without a fight. And I sure hope you are with me in this one.

There are bodies. A LOT of bodies. And {green}we{end} need to get rid of them. And by {green}we{end} I mean {orange}you{end}. I'm counting on you...{blue}CS1{end}.

Carry {green}us{end} on, this one last time.
