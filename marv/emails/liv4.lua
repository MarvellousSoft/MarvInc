Kept you waiting, huh?

I heard you're the new senior in robots!! {purple}Nicely done. {end}I always put in a good word for you, glad you could get a post you deserve, you really know your shit. Fergus was just another bullshitter, he won't be missed.

Keep it up and you might even replace Jen {red}:P {end}(don't tell her I said this, she can get really uptight about her job)

Well, now let's get back to work. Even seniors have to do that {red}:D{end}

So, that first {ds}data structure {end}was simple, but I've seen something glow in Franz's eyes when he saw it done. Let's keep doing it then, I'm sure it will keep the managers happy and it's pretty cool. {pink}L++ rulz{end}

This one might seem the same as the other, but it's harder. Remember it doesn't matter where you store the {num}values{end}, as long as your answers are correct.

Also, notice, like in the previous {ds}DS{end}, you can store all values {red}currently {end}on the {ds}DS {end}(at most 20), but there are not enough registers to store all the values that were ever added to the {ds}DS {end}(at most 100).

Keep senioring, and carry on.
