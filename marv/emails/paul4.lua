{orange}Awesome{end} work on that hallway dude! Good thing {blue}"robots"{end} don't have {cyan}emotions{end}, right? I mean, I'd have gotten PTSD and been scarred for life after having taken all those {brown}bodies{end} out the way.

Anyways, now that the pathway is clear my guys can have the {red}reactor{end} repaired. There is a catch, though. The {red}reactor{end} had a complete {brown}meltdown{end} and the pathway to the {cyan}control room{end} is on {red}fire{end}.

Now I know what you must be thinking. I thought it too. But this is not the appropriate time or place to think about doing a {red}c{green}o{purple}m{brown}m{gray}u{blue}n{cyan}a{red}l {blue}d{green}a{cyan}b{end}, man. It's time to focus on this issue.

Could you put out the {red}fire{end} on the control room so that we can get this situation sorted, please?

Thanks a lot!
