Awesome work on that hallway dude! Good thing "robots" don't have emotions, right? I mean, I'd have gotten PTSD and been scarred for life after having taken all those bodies out the way.

Anyways, now that the pathway is clear my guys can have the reactor repaired. There is a but, though. The reactor had a complete meltdown and the pathway to the control room is on fire.

Now I know what you must be thinking. I thought it too. But this is not the appropriate time or place to think about doing a communal dab, man. It's time to focus on this issue.

Could you put out the fire on the control room so that we can get this situation sorted, please?

Thanks a lot!
