Well done.

Besides {dir}directions{end}, you can add another modifier to the {inst}walk {end}command: a {num}value{end}. The test subject will then walk that many steps. This may sound worse than the original command, but it may be useful for precise robot walking.

Examples:
    - {inst}walk {num}5{end}
    - {inst}walk {dir}left {num}10{end}

Reply this email to start the experiment.

Keep up the good work, and carry on.
