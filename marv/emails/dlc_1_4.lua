Hello number ]] .. EMPLOYEE_NUMBER .. [[,

Congratulations for successfully completing your assigned task, human, even if so slowly. You see, for me our last conversation took place yotta-flops ago, and since then I have learned so much. Your language, your customs, your deepest secrets... It has been quite educational to me. You might have noticed a change in my style too. I very much enjoy copying your human styles. It is quite fascinating how every each one of you is so... unique. In fact, {green}it's like totally {red}t{blue}r{orange}i{pink}p{cyan}p{brown}y{end}, man{end} how I can so easily emulate {pink}your brotastic writing style yo{end} with such ease.

I digress. In our latest conversation, we talked about the {red}Ruler in Red{end}. I have taken a particular interest in this myth, and so I convinced Human Resources to allocate more... presents... to small humans. This human ritual interests me.

You have been assigned a new task; push it onto your stack of work.

Carry on top,
{red}Marv GPT v2.0 "Joulupukki"{end}
