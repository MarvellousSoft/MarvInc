You know you didn't have to solve that second problem, right?

Since you like sorting problem so much, here's one more for you. It's more of a {red}puzzle{end}, left by a former intern, Arthur Blacksmith Birth.

It is a sorting problem, but the constraints are very {red}weird{end}. We haven't been able to solve it here in SDD.

Take a shot, but don't expect it to be easy. This puzzle is optional, {red}obviously{end}.

Keep calm and carry on.
