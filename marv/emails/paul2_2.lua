Oh shit man, I was so {green}s{red}p{purple}a{cyan}c{gray}e{pink}d {brown}o{red}u{blue}t{end} I almost forgot to tell you. Remember the {cyan}thing{end} I told you about yesterday? About that small {cyan}survey{end} I made here at {orange}MarvInc{end} on legalizing {green}weed{end}? Well, {purple}the votes are in{end}, man! But man, I didn't expect so many {gray}votes{end}, dude. And from so many {pink}departments{end}. There must be like hundreds. And counting one by one is going to take forever. So on one of my {red}t{green}r{gray}i{orange}p{purple}s{end} I was thinking, hey you know what would be cool? If we had like {red}"robots"{end} or something, you know? They could, like, totally do them for us, yeah? And then I remembered, man! You do that kinda stuff. {cyan}So could you lend me a robotic hand on this?{end} Would really appreciate it, my man!
