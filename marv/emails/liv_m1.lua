%red% \o/ %end% Franz is gone. I solved the hard one and he was satisfied with our 'results'. I had to lay off a %brown% couple %end% of guys but that's it. It's over for now.

Got a little stressed back there, mainly bc of those fuckups. Tks for covering for them. Gonna lay low for a while now, earned it.
