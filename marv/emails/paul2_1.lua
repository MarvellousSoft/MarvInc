And I don't mean it just literally man (Andy went absolutely nutters, right?). {cyan}Great time man.{end} Glad you, {purple}Liv{end}, {blue}Bill{end}, {red}Miles{end} and all you geekier folks upstairs were there. Gets dull talking only to physicists, engineers and chemists.

Anyways, {blue}Bill{end} and {red}Miles{end} were impressed with the work you have been doing for both me and {purple}Liv{end} and asked me for your email. As you may recall from last night, {blue}Bill Davies{end} and {red}Miles Evans{end} are both {cyan}mathematicians{end} here at {orange}Marv{end}, and they've been doing some really awesome work on {cyan}number theory{end} and {cyan}cryptography{end}. As you know, crunching those primes is a problem they face regularly. They're recently hired, just like you, so I would expect an {pink}email{end} from the duo with some related work once they are all settled in.
