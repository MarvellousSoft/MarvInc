And I don't mean it just literally man (Andy went absolutely nutters, right?). Great time man. Glad you, Liv, Bill, Miles and all you geekier folks upstairs were there. Gets dull talking only to physics, engineers and chemists.

Anyways, Bill and Miles were impressed with the work you have been doing for both me and Liv and asked me for your email. As you may recall from last night, Bill Davies and Miles Evans are both mathematicians here at Marv, and they've been doing some really awesome work on number theory and criptography. As you know, crunching those primes is a problem they face regularly. They're recently hired, just like you, so I would expect an email from the duo with some related work once they are all settled in.

Keep on rolling,
