Hey there {cyan}BSF{end}, how are you doing? Just heard you got a new job. {red}My job{end} actually. So happy for you my dear colleague {green}:)))))))))){end}

I mean, I can {green}completely{end} understand {brown}Karl{end}'s decision to transfer me, with 12+ years experience with Deep Learning Algorithms and Robotic Heuristics Analysis to the Janitorial Department. Such an amazing opportunity! I should be {green}thanking{end} you!!

Well I hope I'm not taking too much time off your busy hands. Must be really hard to program while wiping Karl's ass at the same time {green};){end}. But I can't say much since I got my hands full in the latest diarrhea epidemic in our company. Oh boy I can't wait to use all my PHD knowledge on that!

Carry on and try not to drown in your own vomit. That would be such tragedy. {green}:))))))))))))){end}

PS: {cyan}'BSF'{end} totally does not mean BackStabber {red}[REDACTED]{end}. Promise.
