Let's take it up a notch shall we? You will now learn to use the {addr}registers {end}and two new commands: {inst}write {end}and {inst}add{end}.

{addr}Registers {end}can hold {num}values{end}. Think of them as the memory in your {tab}<code>{end}. To access the {num}content {end}of the {addr}register #n{end}, just write {num}[n]{end}. So if you want the {num}value {end}in the {addr}register #5{end}, you write {num}[5]{end}. You can see them just below your {tab}<code> {end}notepad, with their respective numbers and contents. {addr}Register {end}numbers start from 0, and are located in the top-left corner of a {addr}register{end}, while the {num}content {end}is the big number centered on the box.

The {inst}add {end}command receives three arguments: Two {num}values {end}to be added, and the {addr}address {end}where their sum will be stored.

Look at the following examples:
    - {inst}add {num}[1] 3 {addr}7 {end}# adds 3 to the content of register #1, and stores it at register #7.
    - {inst}add {num}[2] [5] {addr}2 {end}# adds register #2 contents to register #5 contents and stores it at register #2 again.

Finally, the {inst}write {end}command receives a {num}value {end}argument, and a second optional {dir}direction {end}argument. You'll use the {inst}write {end}command to write {num}values {end}in a {orange}console{end}, which are the big colorful computer objects in the room. The {dir}direction {end}determines which direction the {orange}console {end}is. If not provided, as usual, the robot will try to write in the direction he is facing.

The following example writes the {num}contents{end} of {addr}register #2{end} to the {orange}console{end} below the robot:
    - {inst}write {num}[2] {dir}south{end}

Make sure to understand all these concepts. You can do it.

Best of Luck. Carry on. :)
