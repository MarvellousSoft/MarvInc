Greetings, this is Richard. I'm here on behalf of Olivia to give you some insight in the {orange}I/O consoles{end}, as this is the first time you'll be working with them.

{orange}I/O consoles {end}work exactly like regular consoles, but you can both read and write {num}data {end}to it. That means, in reality, they are a place to store {red}temporary {end}data.

Data is written to the end of it, and read from the beginning, so they work in a {ds}FIFO (first in first out) {end}fashion, just like {ds}queues{end}. Remember that whenever you read some data from it, this data is {red}erased{end}.

Overall, a very simple component, and shouldn't need any further explaining.

Pleasure to meet you, carry on.
