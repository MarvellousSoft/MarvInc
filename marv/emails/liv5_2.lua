Greetings, this is Richard. I'm here on behalf of Olivia to give you some insight in the I/O consoles, as this is the first time you'll be working with them.

I/O consoles work exactly like regular consoles, but you can both read and write data to it. That means, in reality, they are a place to store temporary data.

Data is written to the end of it, and read from the beginning, so they work in a FIFO (first in first out) fashion, just like queues. Remember that whenever you read some data from it, this data is erased.

Overall, a very simple component, and shouldn't need any further explaining.

Pleasure to meet you, carry on.
