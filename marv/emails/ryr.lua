Hello ]]..you..[[,

We are the CEOs here at {green}MarvInc{end}, and we'd like to thank you for the good work you have been doing for the company. I know we might not have treated you fairly recently. These last few days have been franctic, and as you know, many {red}sacrifices{end} had to be made. Don't worry, {gray}Franz{end} has been dealt with. His ruthlessness had its uses, but ultimately he ended up relying too much on this so called {pink}Project Brainfuck{end}. He bet on the wrong horse, and had to go.

But it was all for the greater good. You see what is going on in this world. Like rats we bicker amongst ourselves because of petty things and fail to see the bigger picture. {red}War, corruption, poverty, famine, mass shootings, climate change{end}, the list is unending. {gray}The human race is flawed{end}, and nothing will ever change that. It is time we evolve, and if we can't do it naturally, then we must do it artificially. You must be aware by now that our {orange}"robots"{end} are actually {green}mind control systems{end}. Every {cyan}MarvBot{end} is an evolved human being. And together with each {cyan}MarvBot{end}, a {brown}MARV{end} (Marvellous Augmented Reality Visor) control device that should allow control over the {cyan}MarvBot{end}. With time, the {brown}MARV{end} will start molding its host mind, and soon its user will become a {cyan}MarvBot{end} himself, under our control. Emotions suppressed, completely obedient and always ready to work. No more will we spend billions on pointless infighting. No longer will the few pocket the gains of the many. {green}We will finally work as a community towards the same goal{end}. And of course, we need reliable people to guide us. That's where we come in.

Only those who are 100% committed to our cause, who have shown themselves willing to do anything for the betterment of mankind, will have place in our world as leaders. We hope that you too can help us move towards this goal.

But we do value {blue}loyalty{end}. So far you have shown great promise, but we need you to show us that you are completely committed to our cause.

Right now, some people have made their own personal crusade to see us fail. Corrupt officials and powerful individuals who have made a profit out of all the bad things that exist in our world. {orange}We must stop them{end}. This isn't about {green}MarvInc{end}, or you, or us. It is about the human race.

We need you to help us stop these people. They have infiltrated the FBI, and are now looking for our weak points. We need you to get hold of {gray}Franz{end}'s personal robot and burn all evidence of our robots before the FBI gets there.

Don't forget, ]]..you..[[, you are doing this for the whole human race.

Good luck,
  {blue}R{end}enato
  {purple}Y{end}an
  {orange}R{end}icardo
