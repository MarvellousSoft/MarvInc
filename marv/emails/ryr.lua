We send the player an email about how they've gotten rid of the middle man (Karl Franz), both because Karl bet on the wrong horse by throwing all his chips on Project Brainfuck, and because now is a critical moment in MarvInc history. We explain how we're creating a brain control system, and how this should change the world for a better, since humans are an evil, selfish, warring kind. We explain how every step we (the CEOs) take are being watched, and therefore the player should get rid of all incriminating files. And should you fulfill your duty, you will be appointed our right handman. And that the brain control project is ready for mass usage. Make the player believe he is The Chosen One.
