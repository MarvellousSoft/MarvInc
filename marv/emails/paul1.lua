Hey man,

I'm {green}Paul{end} from the {orange}material engineering department{end}. Look man, {red}I got a situation here{end}. Thing is, I told {cyan}Lewis{end} that I needed the new {red}flux translator fluid{end} for the gravitron kernel. Now, I know I too am to blame for relying on such a knucklehead as {cyan}Lewis{end}, but anyways. Well, {cyan}Lewis{end} told {pink}Kevin{end}, the new intern, to go get the {red}FTF{end}. But what he forgot to mention was that we have a new {orange}security system{end} that uses {green}adamantium-slicing lasers{end}... And the {red}FTF{end} just happened to be tightly secured with {green}motion sensor lasers{end}... You see where this is going. As if it weren't bad enough having all the paperwork for dealing with an intern's accidental {red}death{end}, the goddamn {green}lasers{end} ended up setting the entrance to the {blue}bio chem lab{end} on {orange}fire{end}, which resulted in the {blue}BC{end} guys ringing my phone all day demanding I put out the {orange}fire{end} and send help. Anyways, {purple}Sarah{end} got me your phone since you're in the {gray}"robots" department{end} (seriously, what in the fuck do you guys do over there). I know you guys love {blue}challenges{end}, so why not right? It's a win-win, huh? Look, I'll be in your debt forever if you do this for me. Like, I am totally {red}t{green}r{purple}i{gray}p{orange}p{brown}i{blue}n{pink}g{end} right now here, man. I can't deal with {red}fire{end} hazards right now, and {brown}Christoff{end} is already asking questions around here. {cyan}Give me a heads up if you're willing.{end} And listen, man. {cyan}Don't rat on me, bud, ok?{end} I'll get you a {green}s{orange}t{blue}u{red}b{end} once all this blows over.

{red}T{blue}r{orange}i{pink}p {cyan}o{brown}n{gray}, {red}m{pink}y {brown}m{cyan}a{orange}n{end}
