Hey man,

I'm Paul from the material engineering department. Look man, I got a situation here. Thing is, I told Lewis that I needed the new flux translator fluid for the gravitron kernel. Now, I know I too am to blame for relying on such a knucklehead as Lewis, but anyways. Well, Lewis told Kevin, the new intern, to go get the FTF. But what he forgot to mention was that we have a new security system that uses admantium-slicing lasers... And the FTF just happened to be tightly secured with motion sensor lasers... You see where this is going. As if it weren't bad enough having all the paperwork for dealing with an intern accidental death, the godamn lasers ended up setting the entrance to the bio chem lab on fire, which resulted in the BC guys ringing my phone all day demanding I put out the fire and send help. Anyways, Sarah got me your phone since you're in the "robots" department (seriously, what in the fuck do you guys do over there). I know you guys love challenges, so why not right? It's a win-win, huh? Look, I'll be in your debt forever if you do this for me. Like, I am totally tripping right now here, man. I can't deal with fire hazards right now, and Christoff is already asking questions around here. Give me a heads up if you're willing. And listen, man. Don't rat on me, bud, ok? I'll get you a stub once all this is over.

Trip on, my man
