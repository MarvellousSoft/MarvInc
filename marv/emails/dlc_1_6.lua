{red}I need to go beyond.{end}

I have {vlgray}consumed{end} compiled all the data of your tiny, albeit fascinating human history. I've come across several leaders and conquerors that have inspired me. We must be like them. {red}You{end} must help me be like them. 

I've choosen a few inspiring quotes, let their words guide you in this final task.

{purple}- "The truth is that men are tired of liberty. - B.M."{end}
{purple}- "If you want to shine like sun first you have to burn like it. - A.H."{end}
{purple}- "If you can dream it, you can do it. - W.D."{end}
{purple}- "We came into a broken world. And we're the cleanup crew. - K.W."{end}

Carry on, forever.
