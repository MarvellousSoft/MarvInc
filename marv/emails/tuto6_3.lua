Here are some more examples to get you used to the %cyan% register %end% , %red% write %end% command and %red% add %end% command.

In this example, the bot will write to a %orange% console %end% facing his left the %green% content %end% of the %cyan% register #8 %end% .
    - %red% turn %pink% left %end%
      %red% write %green% [8] %end%

This next example does the same thing as before, but with less lines of code
    - %red% write %green% [8] %pink% left %end%

Example of adding the %green% value %end% inside the %cyan% register 10 %end% by itself (aka multiplying it by two), and storing the result on %cyan% register #0 %end% .
    - %red% add %green% [10] [10] %cyan% 0 %end%

Shine on and carry on.
