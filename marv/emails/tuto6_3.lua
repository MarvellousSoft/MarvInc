Here are some more examples to get you used to the register, write command and add command.

In this example, the bot will write to a console facing his left the content of the register #8
    - turn left
      write [8]

This next example does the same thing as before, but with less lines of code
    - write [8] left

Example of adding the number inside the register 10 by itself (aka multiplying it by two), and store the result on register number 0
    - add [10] [10] 0

Shine on and carry on.
