Continuing our work with data structures, let's talk about lists.

But first, we're having a happy hour here in SDD after the work hours, wanna join? I guarantee there will be enough booze to make it interesting, also some games and music.

Please don't tell Jen or Franz, as this isn't exactly "allowed" use of the office :P. Also don't tell Richard cause he'll just bore everyone if he comes. Anyways, see you tonight. You'll finally learn what's here called "shot-code-shot-deploy".

Back to the task, we have worked with sequences before, but now we will be working with a bunch of them at the same time :). I'm sure you will get used to it quickly. For now let's use our (not exactly) new I/O consoles. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Till tonight, carry on.
