Continuing our work with {ds}data structures{end}, let's talk about {ds}lists{end}.

But first, we're having a {purple}happy hour {end}here in SDD after the work hours, wanna join? I guarantee there will be enough booze to make it interesting, also some games and music.

Please don't tell Jen or Franz, as this isn't exactly {gray}"allowed" {end}use of the office {red}:P{end}. Also don't tell Richard cause he'll just bore everyone if he comes. Anyways, see you tonight. You'll finally learn what's here called {red}"shot-code-shot-deploy"{end}.

Back to the task, we have worked with sequences before, but now we will be working with a bunch of them at the same time {red}:){end}. I'm sure you will get used to it quickly. For now let's use our (not exactly) new {orange}I/O consoles{end}. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Till tonight, carry on.
