Greetings and Salutations!

We at {blue}MARVELLOUS INC. {end}are happy to welcome one more member in our ever expanding AI company. We are all about {red}Big Data{end}, {purple}Internet of Things{end}, {blue}Deep Data Mining Learning (DDML){end}, {green}real-time networks for cutting-edge technology {end}and {orange}benchmarking cloud apps {end}(built for {orange}scalability {end}of course). We hope you can meet our standards, {cyan}end-to-end{end}.

As you know, your assignment will be to test our newly developed Artificial Inteligence Humanoids, or {red}robots{end}. You will be working in the {purple}Robot Testing Department{end}, or {purple}RTD{end} for short. You will have to program their behaviour with simple commands so they can fulfill complex tasks. On the right part of screen you have direct access to a camera filming a room. Test subjects (the {red}robots{end} of course) will be placed inside the room, but you can only control them via your {tab}<code>{end}.

This Automated System will guide you if you feel disoriented.

Most importantly, have fun and carry on :)
