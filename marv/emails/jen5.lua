Hello CS2. How are you?

I can't really say much, but someone around Marvinc is causing trouble. Jesus, I just wish for once I could have a week without anyone being a complete idiot or setting the copier on fire. That's the dream.

In short, I'm really busy. So I'll be quick.

Remember our old Navigation System you helped us improve? The one with the maze.
Well, we need it better.
And more efficient.
And with as low lines of code as possible.

So, yeah, the usual.

Make a generic algorithm for us that can traverse any maze, ok?

Thanks CS2. Carry on.
