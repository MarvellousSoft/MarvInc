Hello {blue}CS2{end}. How are you?

I can't really say much, but someone around MarvInc is causing trouble. Jesus, I just wish {red}for once{end} I could have a week without anyone being a complete idiot or setting the copier on fire. That's the dream.

In short, I'm really busy. So I'll be quick.

Remember our old {purple}Navigation System{end} you helped us improve? The one with the maze.
Well, we need it {green}better{end}.
And more {green}efficient{end}.
And with {green}as few lines of code as possible{end}.

So, yeah, the usual.

Make a generic algorithm for us that can traverse any maze, ok?

Thanks {blue}CS2{end}. Carry on.
