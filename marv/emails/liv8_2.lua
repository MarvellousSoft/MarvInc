    text = [[
Good afternoon. Olivia told me to send you some {blue}brainfuck {end}examples in case you still didn't get it. You {red}won't need {end}to code anything in it, but since you're gonna write an {blue}interpreter {end}it is essential to understand it.

I'll be demonstrating only the basic instructions in this email.
   {blue},>,.<.{end}
This example will read two {num}values {end}and print them again, but swapped. It uses two arrays positions to do that.
    {blue}+.<-.>+.<-.>+.<-.{end}
This example will print 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, using two array positions as well.

Hope you got it. If you need more help, {red}Google {end}it.

Nice to see talk to you again, carry on.
