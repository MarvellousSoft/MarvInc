help me out here bro

since i started asking questions and digging around this place, the higher ups began sending me more and more tasks. they are grinding my ass man, and not the good {purple}"hot chick grinding my ass in the club"{end} type of grindin. and im pretty sure they are doing this so i stop sniffing around.

jokes on them, because sniffin is my third best quality. and i know what you are thinking. dont even ask bro. {brown}you dont wanna know.{end}

anyway, i gotta turn to you bro. you gotta help me out. just solve this one task for me, and ill use the time to continue my {blue}broquest to the truth.{end} since you look like the nerdy type who loves chess and probably star wars movies, and im the broest of them bros, im sending you this weird geek chess problem. do a bro a favour and solve it for me?

thanks in advance bro, i know can count on you. you are the chewbacca in my life
