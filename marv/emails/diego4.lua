bro, you know paul right? the cool bro that is always vaping in the parking lot?

well he sent me a few days back a task from finance, but since it was my leg day this week (gotta burn those calfs bro), i only finished it yesterday. weird thing is, something caught my eye bro.

there were lot of labels tagged {red}MEDICAL COSTS{end}. and when i mean a lot, i mean a {gray}fucking lot{end}, every single day. and not a single one with an observation, like the rest of the financial stuff there.

just then i got this {purple}tingly{end} sensation in my balls. and i know that you know that when a bro has a tingly balls sensation, something wrong is cooking up. and my balls were jingling like crazy.

so my investigating instincts kicked in and i went to ask the boss, jennylicious, what those medical things were (i mean, we dont even have dental bro, and that is messed up). she just looked at me and said {gray}"stop asking questions or youll get in trouble"{end}.

something is not right, so ill keep asking questions around. its not me that will get in trouble. {purple}trouble will get in me.{end}

if i find anything else, ill keep you posted. i hope you do the same bro.

keep your eyes open
