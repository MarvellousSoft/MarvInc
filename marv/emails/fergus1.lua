Welcome, fellow tester {gray}(#]] .. EMPLOYEE_NUMBER .. [[){end}!

As {blue}Senior Robot Tester{end} here in our department, I oversee most of the personnel, and would like to personally greet you and introduce you to our staff. {orange}In a couple of years{end}, you will surely be making a big difference here.

I know you must have a lot of questions about the department: What do we really do here? What is the payment for extra hours? Who is the guy with the unicorn hat? I had those same questions when I was a newbie here too, many {orange}many{end} years ago. That is why I hold a Q&A every Wednesday from 15 to 15:30. If you would like to attend please schedule it with the secretary at least 3 days beforehand.

This automated email also contains an {orange}initial task{end}. I hope you can solve it. But {orange}don't be afraid to make mistakes{end}. If you have any doubts, don't hesitate to ask one of your co-workers.

As we say in here, carry on.
