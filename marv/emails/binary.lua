    Hey there wannabe hacker, you know whats major rad? No, not The Goonies you dweeb, binary numbers! :-)

    This eletronic mail (or as we in the tech department like to call, "e-mail" ;-D) will teach all about those before you can call Ghostbusters.

    First things first, how do we write three hundred and forty two in our usual numerical system? Well, thats major easy, it's 342, which means
    3x100 + 4x10 + 2x1, which is totally the same as 3x10^2 + 4x10^1 + 2x10^0

    Actually any number we write will have the same formula. If our number has 5 digits d4, d3, d2, d1, d0, we can write it as:
    d4x10^4 + d3x10^3 + d2x10^2 + d1x10^1 + d0x10^0
    And a number with n digits would have the formula:
    d(n)x10^n + d(n-1)x10^(n-1) + d(n-2)x10^(n-2) + ..... + d1x10^1 + d0x10^0,
    Where d(n), d(n-1), ..., d1 and d0 can be any number from 0-9.

    We call our numerical system the Decimal Numerical System! You don't have to be no Emmet Brown from Back to the Future to see that, ain't I right doc? ;-P

    Ok, lets take it to the max, I can tell you are getting stoked about this. What if, instead of using all our 10 digits, we just used 0 and 1. Could we write any number just those? Yes! We just have to use a Binary Numerical System! Cowabunga!

    So, for instace, the number 342 in binary would be 101010110, which means
    1x2^8 + 0x2^7 + 1*2^6 + 0x2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0
    that is, like, the same as
    1x256 + 0x128 + 1*64 + 0x32 + 1*16 + 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1

    The principles are the same, but instead of multiplying the digits by a power of 10, we multiply them by a power of 2!

    Wanna learn about other numerical systems like hexadecimal? Well barf me out of this one, 'cause I pity the fool who has time for that, and I'm late for a Star Wars trilogy marathon (I bet episode 1 is going to be tubular!)

    Remember, say no to drugs and have a cow man B-)
