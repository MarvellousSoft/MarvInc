What is up my dude?

So I guess you've read it on the newspaper right? About a house in the {gray}West Bay{end} being engulfed in {red}flames{end}, taking half the block with it and {green}Lakeview Park{end} being partially on {red}scorched{end} because of this small incident?

It just so happens that {purple}my house{end} was in the epicenter of this unfortunate event... And yes, maybe I might have been partially responsible for that and maybe I should avoid bringing untested {green}plasma{end} prototypes home. But that could've happened even if I hadn't brought the {gray}PQM-43 modullator{end} home, right?

Anyways, {brown}shit happens{end} and what happens in the past stays in the past. What matters is, I'm moving to a new house in {cyan}West Meadows{end} and things are a mess. I've got all this paperwork the lawyers at {orange}Marv{end} are making me sign because of the {red}"incident"{end}, and I still haven't gotten the chance to make my new {green}home{end} a proper {green}Verkeufen{end}'s home, you know?

Since you got your all powerful, obedient {blue}"robots"{end}, I was wondering if you could help me out on this. As a personal favor. I need the hall painted a {green}certain way{end}... It's quite {blue}a{red}e{green}s{brown}t{purple}h{cyan}e{gray}t{orange}i{yellow}c{end}. I've been pushing for a similar paint job on our labs for quite some time, but fucking {gray}Karl Franz von Lickmyass{end} think it's not "work appropriate".

Let me know if you're up for it.
