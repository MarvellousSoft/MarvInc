What is up my dude?

So I guess you've read it on the newspaper right? About a house in the West Bay being engulfed in flames, taking half the block with it and Lakeview Park being partially on fire because of this small incident?

It just so happens that my house was in the epicenter of this unfortunate event... And yes, maybe I might have been partially responsible for that and maybe I should avoid bringing untested plasma prototypes home. But that could've happened even if I hadn't brought the PQM-43 modullator home, right?

Anyways, shit happens and what happens in the past stays in the past. What matters is, I'm moving to a new house in West Meadows and things are a mess. I've got all this paperwork the lawyers at Marv are making me sign because of the "incident", and I still haven't gotten the chance to make my new home a proper Verkeufen's home, you know?

Since you got your all powerful, obedient "robots", I was wondering if you could help me out on this. As a personal favor. I need the hall painted a certain way... It's quite aesthetic. I've been pushing for a similar paint job on our labs for quite some time, but fucking Karl Franz von Lickmyass think it's not "work appropriate".

Let me know if you're up for it.
