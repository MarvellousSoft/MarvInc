Great party!!! Didn't know Bill was such a wild card ahhahaah, after his dance frenzy, he passed out on the sofa and slept here all night ahhaha.

Don't worry about breaking the server, it happens all the time :P Actually we started doing versioning because of these parties.

Nice work with that playlist! Even Bob got out of the chair.

Hard as it is, let's get back to work. Well, I guess you learned how to use I/O consoles to store lists in the previous task. Now let's do it without them :P

This is basically a harder version of the last task. You have no I/O consoles, so you need to store everything in the registers. Also, now values can be removed from the lists.

Happy coding, and carry on.
