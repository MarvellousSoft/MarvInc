{red}Great party!!! {end}Didn't know Bill was such a wild card ahhahaah, after his dance frenzy, he passed out on the sofa and slept here all night ahhaha.

Don't worry about breaking the server, it happens all the time {red}:P {end}Actually we started doing {red}versioning {end}because of these parties.

Nice work with that playlist! Even Bob got out of the chair.

Hard as it is, let's get back to work. Well, I guess you learned how to use {orange}I/O consoles {end}to store {ds}lists {end}in the previous task. Now let's do it without them :P

This is basically a harder version of the last task. You have no {orange}I/O consoles{end}, so you need to store everything in the {addr}registers{end}. Also, now {num}values {end}can be removed from the lists. (If you pay attention, you'll realize you are actually implementing a bunch of stacks at the same time)

Happy coding, and carry on.
