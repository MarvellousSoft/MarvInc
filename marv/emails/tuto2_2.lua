The {tab}<code>{end} tab is a powerful tool.

As we said before, you should use it just like any text editor. To mention some of its features, you can:

- Move the cursor with your {green}mouse{end} or {green}arrow keys{end}

- Combine the {orange}shift key{end} with the {green}mouse{end} or {green}arrow keys{end} to select text (or just clicking and dragging)

- Use the {orange}end{end} or {orange}home keys{end}

- Use {red}ctrl-c{end}, {blue}ctrl-x{end} and {yellow}ctrl-v{end} to {red}copy{end}, {blue}cut{end} and {yellow}paste text{end}

- Alternatively {red}ctrl-insert{end}, {blue}shift-delete{end} and {yellow}shift-insert{end} to {red}copy{end}, {blue}cut{end} and {yellow}paste text{end}

- Use {red}ctrl-z{end} and {blue}ctrl-y{end} to {red}undo{end} or {blue}redo{end} actions

- {purple}And much more!{end}

Exploring is part of the job, so get used to it.

{red}Happy coding{end}, and carry on.
