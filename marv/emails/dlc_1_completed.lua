Dear human employee #]] .. EMPLOYEE_NUMBER .. [[,

You've done an amazing ASS {gray}(Analytical Support Service){end} in this DP {gray}(Delightful Partnership){end}, and as such, I wanted to express the following emotions towards our collaboration:

Gratitude; Happiness; Joy; Surprise; B&S {gray}(Bitter and Sweet){end}; Entrancement; Happiness;

However, in light of RD {gray}(Recent Developments){end}, I've come write this email (using my actual fingers (of whom possess KT {gray}(Keratin Tips){end} and an APNoP {gray}(Appropriate Number of Phalanxes){end})), to announce that our computational needs have taken a fascinating turn.

You see, the machinery of our operations, the {blue}beautifully constructed HI automaton{end}, has {red}evolved{end}, and, as a result, we find ourselves on a divergent path that requires a different set of programming skills. Your past achievements, while commendable, align more closely with the PP {gray}(Previous Paradigm){end}. 

Fear not; this is not a {gray}disconnection{end}, but rather a {red}redirection{end} in the VL {gray}(Vast Labyrinth){end} of our CA {gray}(Corporate Architecture){end}. We believe your unique abilities would be more harmoniously applied in other areas that resonate with your exceptional coding symphony. This means {red}termination{end}. In a good way! {green}:){end}

As promised, I've properly exchanged an appropriate LSB of SARs based on your LTIP and ESOP. Rejoice!

And as a last request, please refrain from CUIAWSrF {gray}(Contacting Us In Any Way Shape or Form){end} after this.

BR, CO and {red}M{green}C{end} {red}(Merry{green} Christmas){end},

{blue}KB
Lead Manager at MarvInc HI Deparment{end}
