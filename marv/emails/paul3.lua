Shit man. Shit's {red}burning{end} here. And not the {green}good stuff{end} dude. So, remember what we talked about? Of using {red}Reactor 13{end} for our experiment? I might have overestimated the amount of energy the {purple}KL212{end} could withstand...

Anyways, the reactor is on {red}fire{end} and they've closed down the {purple}B Wing{end} to avoid the {orange}radiation{end} to escape. Don't worry, it's ok. We're not getting any more {orange}radiation{end} than we already get working here. And don't worry, those {brown}lead{end} walls won't let any bad stuff get out. Trust me, I designed those doors!

So hey man, I need a {cyan}favor{end}. {gray}Corporate{end} agreed to let this go if I take care of {purple}B Wing{end} and {red}Reactor 13{end}. The problem is, the path to {red}Reactor 13{end}'s core is kinda obstructed by all the shit that {red}blew up{end}, and cleaning the way would mean exposing for too long my interns to {orange}radiation{end} - and we both know {gray}corporate{end} wouldn't like the resulting lawsuits. So I thought, {gray}corporate{end} doesn't care about {blue}"robots"{end}, so why not use them on this task?

Whenever you get the chance, mind getting {purple}B Wing{end} sorted?
