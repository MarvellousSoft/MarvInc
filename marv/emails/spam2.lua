I am Mrs. Marina Luda, I am a US citizen, 48 years Old. I reside here
in Florida USA.My residential address is as follows, 7008 E Hwy 326
Silver Springs FLorida 34488 United States,am thinking of relocating
since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the
compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I
had paid over $85,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to
no avail.

So I decided to travel to Washington with all my compensation
documents, And I was directed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
Director to contact Barrister Stephen Nelson, who is a representative of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a member of the Compensation
Award Committee, currently in Nigeria and I contacted him and he
explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through
emails are fake.

He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation
payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I
have received my compensation funds of $10.5 Million US
Dollars,Moreover,Barrister Stephen Nelson showed me the full information of
those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as
one of the beneficiaries on the list he showed me, that is why I
decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not
with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise
you to contact Barrister Stephen Nelson. Kinldy send your personal details
to him to prove your identification.

Full Name:
Home Address:
Occupation:
Phone Number:
Age:
Gender:
country:

You have to contact him directly on this information below.

Compensation Award House
Name :Barrister Stephen Nelson
Phone:+2348103650480
Email: barristerstevennelson112@gmail.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting
you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway
with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you
up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met Barrister
Stephen Nelson was just $355 USD for the paper works, take note of that.

Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact
Barrister Stephen Nelson so that he can help you to deliver your fund
instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around
asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be Blessed.
