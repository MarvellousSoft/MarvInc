You have proven yourself useful and true to the MarvInc cause. As such, I expect you to perform another task for me.

There have been... {gray}Rumors{end}. Leaks. And a certain federal agency has been investigating us.

As is usual of the American inefficiency, they rely heavily on humans. And in the FBI case, snitches. It appears that they have recently lost their only rat in the inside... It is fortunate that we are not dealing with the Bundeskriminalant. Otherwise we would already be peeling Kartoffeln in the Bundesgef√§ngnis. Ha! And they say german humor is nonexistant.

But we must take further precautions in order for this to never happen again. We must perform a thorough cleaning of the MarvInc facilities, getting rid of any evidence. The FBI's next move is a ground operation, and we must be both clean and prepared for what they may throw at us.

For this reason, I want you and Ms. Janine Leubwitz to prepare ground. Clean every facility in this compound of any trace of misconduct.

Do not disappoint me, ]] .. you .. [[.

Karl Franz F. L. von Linz
General Executive Manager
