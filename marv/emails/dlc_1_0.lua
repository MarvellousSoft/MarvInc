Dear, employee #]] .. EMPLOYEE_NUMBER .. [[,

I trust this message finds you in great spirits and enjoying the dynamic challenges that come with our innovative work at Marvellous Inc. I've been following your recent accomplishments closely, and I must say, your {yellow}exceptional{end} problem-solving skills have reached the minds and hearts within our {cyan}HI{end} department.
(That is {cyan}Human Intelligence{end}, since we don't like to use the word {gray}Artificial{end} around here {green};){end})

In the spirit of fostering collaboration and leveraging the extraordinary talents within our team, I find myself faced with a {purple}unique opportunity{end} that aligns perfectly with your capabilities. Recently, I had the privilege of addressing a rather {purple}complex scenario{end} in a certain sector of our division, a sort of {gray}"emergency shift"{end} within the hierarchical structure between our fellow employees, and where a {purple}meticulous touch{end} is required to ensure optimal functionality and efficiency moving on.

Since it comes to my attention that this is one of your {yellow}specialties{end}, I've attached the problem within this email. Please, whenever you have the time, we would love your input so we can resume our activities as soon as possible.

Best regards and carry on,

Karen Bakshi
Lead Manager at Marvellous Inc. HI Deparment
