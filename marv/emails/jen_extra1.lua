I've just received notification of your performance in the binary puzzle, and I must say... I'm actually {blue}impressed!!{end}

{gray}Notice how I just used double exclamation marks to emphasize my emotions. I seldom do that. You can enjoy the moment now.{end}

You created a very robust algorithm to that task, something I should have expected from someone at your position, so I share with you one of the hardest puzzles I've come across during my career.

Consider it as a {green}special optional challenge{end}. Do you have what it takes to create a short but efficient program to solve it?

Carry on and prove your worth.
