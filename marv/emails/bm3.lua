They're {red}madmen{end}! All of them! {red}Madmen{end}!

Don't they understand that {cyan}math{end} isn't like one of their {green}spreadsheets{end}?! That you can't just manipulate math to fit your agenda?!

Now I understand why we were hired as {brown}replacements{end}. They either saw reason and left or {red}lost their minds{end} trying to find a solution!

I'm sorry to burden you with all this. I just needed to get all of this off my chest. I unfortunately cannot tell you what is troubling my, and Miles', minds, as this is a highly {red}confidential{end} task we were assigned.

Because of all this, I must ask for your {blue}help{end}. Miles and I are going to be... away, as {gray}MarvInc{end} sees this assignment of ours as of too much importance given the current {red}robot{end} situation. I also suspect they don't want us running away as did the previous owners of our room...

The only thing I can tell you is that we're working on an {orange}encryption system{end} for your so called "robots". And we need your help for some {green}test cases{end} we'll be running. If you agree to help us, send me the dataset once you're finished.

Thank you,
Bill Davis
