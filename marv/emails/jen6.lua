Hey {cyan}BSF{end}. How are things?

Just kidding, I couldn't care less! {green}:){end}

Anyway, apparently handling the systematics for all the pipes in our building isn't hard enough, so now they gave me the task to clean the whole {red}mess{end} that happened at the Testing Facility A51 last thursday. There is already too much on my plate with this whole {gray}FBI-investigation-thing{end} Franz is shoving on me, so I started searching for alternatives.

But as a great mind once said: {blue}Sometimes we search for one thing and discover another{end}. And I discovered you are also responsible for cleaning this whole clusterf***.

Oh and also that you are {red}forever in debt to me{end} after that whole {gray}hey-lets-be-friends-so-I-can-backstab-you-and-steal-your-job{end} situation you played on me. But hey! No grudges! {green};){end}

So do your job and clean this whole mess, ok? Ok.

Carry on.
