Shit just keeps piling up. I'm sending you one more.

Look, I know this is not fair. If you solve {num}2 {end}out of these {num}3{end} tasks I sent you, I will solve the {purple}hardest{end} and we can hopefully get Franz off our asses.

As for Vega and Fergus, well, they won't {red}forget{end} this little episode

Let me tell you a bit about this task. We are trying to create a so-called {ds}data structure{end}. Basically you have to read a bunch of operations and do what it says for each of them. It would be fun if we weren't under such fucking pressure.

Wait, did I tell you you can use {green}characters{end} as {num}numbers{end}? Yep, all {num}characters are numbers{end}, 'a' is {num}97{end}, 'b' is {num}98 {end}and so on. Checkout {blue}asciitable.com {end}if you need to know more codes. This means '{inst}mov {num}+ {addr}12{end}' is the same as '{inst}mov {num}43 {addr}12{end}'. This makes queries look much prettier. You don't actually need to know the codes to use this...

I don't screw up, so you can always assume the input is valid.

Power through, and carry on.
