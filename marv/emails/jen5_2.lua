We received a lot of noise complaints last week regarding some kind of {pink}festivities{end} taking place in the Marvellous Inc facilities. I hope you all understand this is a serious matter, and our company is for work and work-related activites {red}ONLY{end}.

More importantly, I heard there were employees from my department in said event. If indeed there was some kind of {pink}"party"{end}, I am surprised I received no invitation whatsoever. And if its because of my costume on Halloween last year, I understand now that {purple}Slutty Pumpkin{end} was an inappropiate costume for a social-work event, and it won't happen again.

For now this is just a warning. But if I find more condoms under my desk, {red}the whole department will be punished{end}.

Carry on.
